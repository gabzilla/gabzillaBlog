<h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
  <p>As I am tinkering behind the scenes with my google chrome extension I needed to create a simple little interface for the potential user to interact with. While its great practice right now to start projects from scratch and write HTML and CSS by hand I also wanted something that would be easy to upkeep and change. I decided to lean on an awesome little thing called
  <a href="http://http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>. This is a popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for creating responsive websites and projects. It's possible that bootstrap might be a little overkill for my little project but they have conventions and set styling guides which makes it easy for anyone to jump in and start making changes that are easy to understand. </p>

 <h2>So what is responsive web design?</h2>

  <p>Simply put it means that a website has been created in such a way that all of its content (such as images and structure) will retract to fit any size screen. This means as the designer you don't have to worry about creating different websites for different devices which means having a responsive site is easier to maintain. This becomes increasingly important as the popularity and accessibility of mobile devices grows. In addition our friendly neighborhood superhero Google can use their bots more efficiently to "crawl" through your website to help with SEO (search engine optimization). </p>

  <h3>Here's a fun example that perfectly explains how responsive design works.</h3>

<p>So back to Bootstrap. Keep in mind that this is not the only one out there but personally I think their documentation is decent and since it is popular its pretty easy to find examples of other people's projects. To get started just head on over to the website and click on the tab "Getting Started". I'm already using a package manager called NPM (for more information regarding downloading node and npm <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank"> click here </a> or get started by pulling up terminal and pulling up your project of choice typing in </p>
  `npm install bootstrap`

  <p>Once Bootstrap is added to your project you can either snag one of their examples to get you started or if a tutorial feels like a more comfortable place to start I think [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_get_started.asp) has a really nice one that breaks down everything you need to create your first responsive website. Also be sure to pay extra special attention to the Bootstrap Grid System. Check out
  <a href="http://www.helloerik.com/the-subtle-magic-behind-why-the-bootstrap-3-grid-works" target="_blank">this article</a> which helps explain what and why the Bootstrap grid system is neccessary and why it works. These are some of my favorite resources to reference for creating responsive websites including this blog <a href="http://www.gabzillah.com" target="_blank">gabzillah.com</a> ! I'm still working on having the rest of my other blog posts updated here but for now I hope these resources will help get you prepped to create a responsive site of your own.</p>
