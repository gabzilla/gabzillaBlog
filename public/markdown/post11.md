<p>This comic is basically me every week. Learning to program isn't easy. Accepting that failure is unavoidable and will happen often can be difficult to deal with as well. Despite being a part of some great beginner communities such as CodeNewbies, FreeCodeCamp and WomenWhoCode it is still a struggle mentally to keep reminding myself that this is not some impossible thing to achieve. Thankfully there are some ways to help alleviate the frustration and confusion. This includes: learning how to google, breaking down problems, rubber duck debugging and most importantly asking for help. I'm still pretty new to actual testing and debugging techniques so these are less technical ways to try to solve problems.</p>

<p>So here's some ways to work through major pain points in order to stay on track and avoid this: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ </p>


<p>Before you start anything double check for syntax errors. Seems silly I know but especially with JavaScripts free form jive its easy to fall victim to making some sort of simple error such as mistyping the name to a variable. If its still not working try googling your problem. This however takes practice knowing what kind of keywords to look for and what kind of solutions are applicable. Also pitfall alert: this is probably the easiest place to get distracted. Its a good idea to set a timer for 10-15 minutes of research time. This keeps your eyes on the prize and any new information can always be bookmarked to read later. </p>

<p>If your problem is not knowing where to start or how to approach a problem it helps to sit down and create some sort of game plan. Break down your problem from big picture into small milestones that can eventually be pieced together. Smaller tasks are much more approachable and as time goes on its a good idea to start looking at design patterns to assist with writing maintainable, usable, and readable code.As a beginner however these are good concepts to keep in mind but it is more important to focus on understanding concepts and applying them. </p>


<p>Still having trouble? Sometimes it helps to explain a problem out loud to a person or even a rubber duck! It doesn't have to be a rubber duck necessarily but the idea is to explain your code line for line to something and in doing so typically you end up stumbling on the answer to your problem or catching other potential bugs. Here's an <a href="https://pressupinc.com/blog/2014/06/psychology-underlying-power-rubber-duck-debugging/" target="_blank">article</a> explaining the psychology behind this concept and why it works.</p>

<p> My last piece of advice is one I personally have a hard time doing. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Especially if you've exhausted every resource above and you're still drawing a blank its okay. Programming isn't easy and everyone has been in the same place you are now. Its good to ask questions and then take that answer and keep some form of notes for those solutions. Learn from them, keep references and most importantly just keep working at it. It is okay to fail it just means that your one step closer to finding a solution and even come back to that problem after you have solved it a few days, a few weeks or even a few months later and rework it. You'll be amazed at how far you've come and how you approach things slightly different with time. </p>

<small> Ps. If all else fails: get up, get away from your computer and get outside. Go for a walk, go for a run, do some yoga, anything. Studies have shown that increased oxygen consumption leads to increased cognitive function! </small>
