Exygy: Empowering change makers with tech that improves lives

Things to reduce bias
1. job application diversity Inclusive
2. focused on building a better pipeline > needed to tap into talent markets
   organizations: whc gdi hackbright ect.
3. rooney rule for all open postions at exygy must interview a qualifed candidate
from both of the following - racial background and a women
... so at what point do companies stop hiring for quality ?? by specifically singling
out racial groups and interviewing based on gender doesnt that perpetuate this bias?
4. interviews
5. tiger team! diversity and Inclusion team.
  > self organized teams

giving back to the community with community driven projects to help imporve the quality
of life of these underrepresented racial groups
- creates a way to hire disadvantged community members
