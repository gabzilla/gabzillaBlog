<h3><em>Interview Questions for a Front-End Developer</em></h3>

  <h4>JavaScript</h4>
<ol>
      <li> How many years of experience have you had programming?</li> <br>
          <ul>&bull; I started learning basic HTML and CSS about a year ago and then moved on to 
          Java and JavaScript about 6 months ago.</ul>
      <li> What are Closures?</li> <br>
          <ul>&bull; "A closure is the local variables for a function - kept alive after the function has returned,
            or. A closure is a stack-frame which is not reallocated when the function returns"
            Above is a definition of a closure but this is a concept I'm still not completely familiar with. </ul>
      <li> What is the difference between Sync vs Async?</li> <br>
          <ul>&bull; Synchronous would refer to a block of statements that would execute in order while Asyncronous refers 
            to statements that can be ran without waiting or ran in the background of the program which is especially useful in single page web applications.</ul>
      <li> What are Promises?</li> <br>
          <ul>&bull; A promise is an object that represents the eventual outcome of a an asynchronous operation this allows for better error handling and allows us to avoid the "pyramid of doom".  </ul>
      <li> How do you approach debugging JS? I.e. User clicks on a submit element and nothing happens.</li> <br>
        <ul>&bull; To approach debugging in JS first I open up console scanner and check to see if there are any obvious errors. 
          If there isn't an error being thrown I'll start to break down my code and use the console to set breakpoints and see if I have any logical errors.
          Once I've tried that if it is still not working I'll double check for syntax errors then try to research to find a solution. 
          If I've exhausted all my resources are still stuck then I'll find someone with more experience and ask for help. </ul>
      <li> &bull; Have you used Ember? If no, what frameworks have you worked with previously? </li>
  <br>
      <ul>Yes I have used Ember to build a few personal projects but I have not worked with it in production. I have also tried out Laravel but have not worked with it reccently.</ul>
</ol>
