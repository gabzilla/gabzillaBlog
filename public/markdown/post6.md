<h1>Google Design</h1>
<p>I was given a task this week to find placeholders for a project. Since <a href="http://placekitten.com" target="_blank">placekitten</a> doesn't have icons I took to the web to find something open source to use and suddenly remembered a something that has been tucked away in my <em>"coolstuff.md"</em> file for months. <a href="http://design.google.com/icons" target="_blank">Google Design</a>! The goals Google has prescribed for this site are to: </p>

  <blockquote>"Create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science"</blockquote>

  <p>This website has a mecca of design resources, guidelines, best practices, color palettes, templates and best of all tons of icons. Its all Open Source and their documentation is positively poetic.</p>

  <p>So it was obviously the best choice for the job, I snagged a few icons and was about to send them off when one the subject of changing their colors came up. Having zero experience with Photoshop or Illustrator I started exploring the documentation to see if there was another way and luckily for me there was!</p>

  <p>These icons are a part of Google Web Fonts and adding them to HTML only took one line of HTML:</p>

 ```<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">```

  <p>To incorporate them would look something like this:</p>

  ```<i class="material-icons">reload</i>```

  <p>Here's a picture of a few that are available but they can all be found <a href="https://design.google.com/icons/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>The awesome part is that since these are all fonts they can be manipulated with CSS! There are guidelines that google recommends but after a little time and some tinkering I was able to change up the colors to my every whim!</p>

  <p>Upon a little more research I realized that Google has created a beautiful thing. This framework standardizes their applications by providing clear, detailed, and well documented guidelines for design that promote best practices across all of their platforms. It is really exciting to stumble upon something that helps non design-savvy people like me create beautiful things and I can't wait to take all these concepts and apply them to my own personal projects.</p>
