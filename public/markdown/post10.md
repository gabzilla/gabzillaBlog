<h1>Mock Interview</h1>
<p>Inspired by the flurry of interviews at my internship I had a chance to sit down and have a mock interview with a friend and senior developer. We went through each question and after I had answered he discussed why he choose these questions in particular and the answers he looks for when hiring new developers. </p>
<p> He emphasized the importance of having practical knowledge and that if they get past this initial interview he puts aside a day to have them come in and work on contract for the day. This gives the company the opportunity to see if the developer is a good fit and see how well they do with problem solving and pairing with one of their engineers. I found it especially interesting that he doesn't actually include anything about prior education rather can gage from the responses and how they handle the pair programming exercise. In some cases he has even opted to hire a less experienced individual who is willing to learn and struggle with new concepts.</p>

 <p> After our discussion it seemed like every podcast I listened to that week talked about something to do with the hiring process, finding a good fit and growing in this industry. My three favorites were CodeNewbie: Ep 83 "How to Get a Coding Job", FrontEnd Happy Hour: Ep 005 "Interviews make us drink" and JavaScript Jabber: Ep 207 Growing Happy Developers.</p>
<p>In case you're interested here are the questions asked by a real life software engineer every company has a unique hiring process but if you can nail these questions chances are you'll be off to a great start! :) </p>
