<h1>From tutorials to "real life"..</h1>
  <em>Week two of my internship has thankfully been much less hectic. Now that the crisis had been resolved from the following week one of the developers took some time to sit down with me, build another chrome extension, and to show me what Java looked like in a real world application. He did explain that while it is essentially Java the Android API does not use a JVM but instead uses something called Android Runtime and uses the open-sourced Java libraries called OpenJDK. After that quick overview he wanted to talk about OOP or Object Oriented Programming.</em>

 <p> Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way to design a program using classes and objects. I made myself a quick "cheat sheet" to help keep some of these terms straight with the help of:
 [<em>OOP Concepts</em>](http://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts)

  </p>

  <p>The cheat sheet will be helpful eventually but I encountered a major problem this week. Self taught tutorials and videos haven't really helped me internalize these concepts. It's a hard gap to overcome, taking the leap from tutorials to practical application. That's the beauty of this internship at least, the developers know I am still learning and have recommended some resources for me to continue to work on the fundamentals of this particular language. Armed with Eloquent JavaScript, [<em>Free Code Camp</em>](http://www.FreeCodeCamp.com ) and this "helpful" graph of what being a real coder is like, I am excited to sit down next week and map out how these fundamentals will apply to my Google Chrome Extension project. </p>
